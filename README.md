Thai translation of "Bhagavad Gita As It Is" online

As devotees struggle with uploading this latest edition of Thai "Bhagavad Gita As It Is" text on their ISKCON websites this repo gives a quick and dirty public access via bgthai.github.io address.

The script and sources used to create these html files are in "scripts4bgthai" repository.

This is vanilla vedabase look, which means I relied only on the main vedabase.io css file and any extra rules had to go either into the head on inserted inline. This is not kosher but it works.

This site uses only 3% of the original vedabase css rules so everything unnecessary has been stripped and this local vedabase.css file was made to look readable to human eye. If you see insanely named class rules there - those are preserved from vedabase.io. The only changes I added (around line 130) were to the width of the container element so that lines do not become long on wide screens - a beef of mine with the vedabase site. I always have to install css tweaking addons in the browsers to read it comfortably.

If you want to host Thai Bhagavad Gita on your site and need custom headers or css or you need it in xml format for import into wordpress or whatever - I'll try to make a custom version for you and that would be done in scripts4bgthai repo. If you have a good idea on how to transform these html files using python, php, or whatever script of your choice - this would make it only more interesting. 

This offer is mainly for devotees who know me personally and know how to contact me. For everybody else it's just a public access point, my name is not important. The purpose is to give you an opportunity to read Bhagavad Gita in Thai language.

This new edition is based on the original Ramalaxman's translation, it has been (slightly) edited by Kanupriya Devi Dasi, and the main difference is that it uses internationally accepted system of transliteration of Sanskrit into Thai. The guide to using this system, known as "Pali Sanskrit", has been provided, too. Unlike the paper book, which you can obtain from your local ISKCON devotees, this edition doesn't have any pictures, it's text only. Illustrations in the paper book are gorgeous and you should definitely buy it.

Otherwise - read this Bhagavad Gita, chant Hare Krishna, and be happy.
